## Address form field mapping

Depending on your checkout form fields the selected address data might not be placed in the form fields you would like.
The mapping from form field names to address data is defined in [addressFieldMapping.js](https://github.com/postcode-nl/PostcodeNl_Api_WooCommerce/blob/master/assets/js/addressFieldMapping.js).
By changing `PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.mapping` you can assign your own preferred address data parts to their respective form fields.

An example of a mapping where `_address_1` is used for the street, `_house_number` for the house number `_address_2` for the house number addition:
```javascript
PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.mapping = {
	'_address_1': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.street,
	'_house_number': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.houseNumber,
	'_address_2': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.houseNumberAddition,
	'_postcode': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.postcode,
	'_city': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.city,
};
```
To use this mapping replace `PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.mapping = {...};` with the code above.
