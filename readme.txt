Address autocomplete and validation using the Postcode.eu API. Supports both Dutch and international addresses.

== Description ==

Postcode.eu Address validation provides address autocomplete and validation with an easy to implement API. The API offers addresses from several European countries, and more countries are constantly being added. We only work with official sources such as postal companies and governments to ensure high quality and accurate data that is up to date.

The Postcode.eu Address Validation plugin uses the Dutch Postcode API and International Address API to streamline the checkout process. By offering autocomplete suggestions for both Dutch and international addresses, it simplifies address input for customers. This functionality helps improve the accuracy of deliveries, reduce return rates due to incorrect addresses, and increase overall customer satisfaction. The result is a more efficient e-commerce operation with a higher conversion rate.

== Installation ==

= Limiting orders from regions of a country =

Shipping can be limited by setting up [Shipping Zones in WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/document/setting-up-shipping-zones/).

For example, limiting shipping to French overseas territories, set up a shipping zone for France and add a postcode range of 97000...99000. Add specific shipping options, or only local pick up. Make sure the shipping zone is near the top of the list, shipping zones are matched from top to bottom.

= Address form field mapping =

Depending on your checkout form fields the selected address data might not be placed in the form fields you would like.
The mapping from form field names to address data is defined in [addressFieldMapping.js](https://github.com/postcode-nl/PostcodeNl_Api_WooCommerce/blob/master/assets/js/addressFieldMapping.js).
By changing `PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.mapping` you can assign your own preferred address data parts to their respective form fields.

An example of a mapping where `_address_1` is used for the street, `_house_number` for the house number `_address_2` for the house number addition:
```javascript
PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.mapping = {
	'_address_1': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.street,
	'_house_number': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.houseNumber,
	'_address_2': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.houseNumberAddition,
	'_postcode': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.postcode,
	'_city': PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.city,
};
```
To use this mapping replace `PostcodeNlAddressFieldMapping.mapping = {...};` with the code above.
